## HORSE RACE SIMUALTOR ##

This game is a horse race simulator that allows the player to customize the number of horses and the length of the race. 

During the race, a horse may fall, resulting in its elimination from the race. 

Horses are assigned a confidence rating ranging from 0 to 1. 

A higher confidence rating indicates faster running speed, but also increases the likelihood of falling. 

Winning a race slightly increases a horse's confidence, while falling during a race slightly decreases it.

## HOW TO RUN ##
